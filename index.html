<p>Climate change is a very controversial but important topic in the world today.
Climate change is the sum of global warming and its effects, caused by the rising average 
temperature of the earth. Overwhelming scientific opinion argues that climate change is largely
the result of human use of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal.</p>

<h2 style="color: blue;">Topics</h2>
<p><strong>Deforestation</strong> - Deforestation is when the forests and other woodland of the
world are cut down to make the land available for other uses. Deforestation drives loss of habitats
and extinction of species.</p>
<p><strong>Air Pollution</strong> - Air Pollution occurs when harmful gases are released into the 
atmosphere. This pollution can cause disease, allergies and death to humans, and possibly to animals
and other life forms as well.</p>
<p><strong>Wildfires</strong> - Wildfires are naturall occurring events that are said to promote forest
health. Increasing droughts have meant that wildfires have increased in number and spread more easily as
a result.</p>
